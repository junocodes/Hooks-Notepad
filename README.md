# Hooks Notepad

A simple CRUD application built with React hooks. Based on a [tutorial](https://taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/) by Tania Rascia. The main purpose of this project was to help me gain a better understanding of hooks and how to use them properly. So instead of focusing on visuals, I decided to integrate [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling.

### Enjoy!
